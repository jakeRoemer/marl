This prototype application was used to gather results for the provided MARL paper which contains further details on the game and experiments conducted.
It is mostly just interesting to look at since single player vs. ai game play has been left to future work.

The game is simple, a turn based tactics game where units can attack and/or move on a grid within line of sight, a radius of movement speed + 1. Friendly fire is enabled to test the power of reinforcement learning. Units should learn not avoid attacking friendlies and to attack enemies. 
A fog of war prevents units from seeing each other or enemies. Hard to win without coordination or sharing information between units.
Oracle units share line of sight information between all friendly units.
Cooperative units share line of sight information between a subset of friendly units.
Independent units do not share any information.

Each team starts off without prior learning enabled and must learn how to play over the number of rounds set. Larger team sizes playing a large number of rounds will show how information sharing effects the success of the ai.

To run:
$ java -classpath commons-lang3-3.4.jar:commons-math3-3.5.jar:mockito.jar:target/classes edu.osu.cse.marl.GameRunner <team1> <team2> <# of rounds>

team1/team2 options: cooperative, independent, and oracle.
Suggested: cooperative independent 1000

Team option scripted is a deprecated option used to train ai and gather results. 

GameOptions.java provides further options but must be changed in file:
team size 	- number of units per team [default 3]
board size 	- x by y dimensions of game board [default 5 by 8]
turn limit 	- number of turns before game terminates if no clear winner [default 50] 
turn speed 	- time [in milliseconds] each turn takes [default 100, only relevant if replay is false]
replay 		- enables single turn play. Right button progresses readied team to take a single turn. Left button returns to the prior turn taken. [default false for autoplay]
actionText 	- enables debug information of each unit's action. Mainly used for single turn play and intended for 3 units. [default false]
autoHomogeneousState - determines if a unit uses similar states to determine action [default false]
